# RE-Flex

RE-Flex is a simple to use framework to perform relation extraction using the contextualized representations produced from masked language models such as BERT and RoBERTa. Instead of simply querying the model,
RE-Flex uses the hidden representations produced by the model to find the token in the input sequence that best matches the prediction the from the language model.
